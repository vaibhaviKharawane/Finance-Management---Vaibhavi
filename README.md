Personal Finanace Management:
The Expense management project is designed to create a platform where users can create, view, edit, and delete expense with real-time updates. The platform ensures that any changes made to any expense are instantly reflected across all reports. This project will provide you with hands-on experience in implementing user authentication, managing documents, and ensuring real-time collaboration using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

USING MERN STACK
MERN STACK:
M:**MongoDB** is a document-oriented database that's used for its performance, scalability, and availability. It's a good choice for mobile apps, prototyping, and trying out new ideas. 
E:**ExpressJs** Express.js is a popular Node.js web application framework that simplifies server-side development by providing tools for routing, middleware, and HTTP utilities, making it easier to build web applications and APIs. 
R:**React**:React provides reusability of components, fast rendering, code stability, high performance, and extensive community support
N:**NODEJS**:Node.js is a versatile JavaScript runtime environment employed for server-side and networking applications. It excels in handling concurrent requests efficiently due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture. Node.js finds use in building real-time applications like chat apps and streaming services, as well as dynamic websites and single-page applications. Its ability to use JavaScript on both the front-end and back-end streamlines development and allows for code reuse. Additionally, Node.js is suitable for data-intensive applications and microservices architectures, making it scalable for startups and large enterprises alike.
